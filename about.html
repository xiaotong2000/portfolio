<h1>Xiaotong Huang</h1>

<p>My name is Xiaotong Huang or I go by Nicole if you can't pronounce the first one. I am going to be a senior at KIPP San Jose Collegiate. I participated in my school's Girls Who Code club and I realized I really like coding. Before, I thought I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, but I changed my mind. I want to be a computer scientist now! YAY!!!</p>
