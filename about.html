<h1>Xiaotong Huang</h1>

<p>My name is Xiaotong Huang or I go by Nicole if you can't pronounce the first one. I am going to be a senior at KIPP San Jose Collegiate. I participated in my school's Girls Who Code club and I realized I really like coding. Before, I thought I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, but I changed my mind. I want to be a computer scientist now! YAY!!!</p>

<p>Reflection 6/20/17: 1. The similarties and differences between Python and Scratch are the idea of loops. The differences are Python have more specific types of loops that proceed under a certain situation. 
   2. While trying out Python, the most common struggle we had was the syntax and the different commands. At first, we didn't know how exactly each command works, but as then slowly it made more sense on how to use different commands to do different things in our program.
