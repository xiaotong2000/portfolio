<h1>Xiaotong Huang</h1>

<p>My name is Xiaotong Huang or I go by Nicole if you can't pronounce the first one. I am going to be a 
    senior at KIPP San Jose Collegiate. I participated in my school's Girls Who Code club and I realized 
    I really like coding. Before, I thought I wanted to be a neurosurgeon, but I changed my mind.</p>

<p>Reflection 6/20/17: 1. The similarties and differences between Python and Scratch are the idea of loops. 
    The differences are Python have more specific types of loops that proceed under a certain situation. 
   2. While trying out Python, the most common struggle we had was the syntax and the different commands. At first, 
    we didn't know how exactly each command works, but as then slowly it made more sense on how to use different 
    commands to do different things in our program. 
<p>Reflection 6/23/17: 1. Today I learned that there are different data structures in python. I learned that in 
    python lists are mutable while tuples are immutable. Lists are written in brackets and tuples are written with parentheses.
    Lists are useful when you want to add more objects to the list because you can use list.append or list.extend to add on to
    your list.
    2. I think all groups worked well together because for each project there are different obstacles and different requirements
    that we need to program together. In each group, we struggled, but at the end we worked well together to resolve the problem 
    got the program/game to work. 
    3. I like how I learned how to program in python and I realized that you can use a few line of codes to program something. 
<p> Robotics Day 1 Reflection 6/26/17:
    1. Today, I learned that there are many types of robots and there are many different criteria that a robot need to meet. I would
    define a robot as a programmed machine that automatically performs an action under a set of instructions. Knowing the advancements 
    of technology and artifical intelligence, robots will only improve its functions. 
    2. Our group worked well on working together to get the circuits working and teaching each other about the different ways of making 
    different circuits.
<p> Robotics Day 4 Reflection 6/29/17:
    This week, I learned about robotics and its language. We managed to program the robot to move, dance, and move away from objects
    blocking its path. It was really difficult to get the accurate movement and turns of the robot at first, but after many trial and 
    error the robot managed to perform decently.
<p> Reflection 7/11/17
    1. One new thing I learned about how the internets work is the whole process is very complicated and complex. When we use the
    internet, it gives us the results really fast, but actually there are a lot of things that are happening in the background.
    2. LaTeX is a markup language as it is used to give content to the documents, but it can still be used to style and format the
    documents. 
<p> Reflection 7/13/17
    1. I would like to make my Django site first before I can add anything to it. 
    2. I want to learn how to add images and how to make them the size I want them to be or how to animate them so it shifts by itself.
    3. I could create my own resume with the same structure.
